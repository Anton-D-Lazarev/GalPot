falPot
============

This is a stand-alone version of [Walter Dehnen's GalaxyPotential C++ code](http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/1998MNRAS.294..429D). It is a version I took from the falcON code in the [NEMO Stellar Dynamics Toolbox](http://chara.astro.umd.edu/nemo/), and cut down to stand alone.

It should compile if you run make.

It is under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

It comes with no warranty, especially not from Walter. I leave it here simply for convenience.
