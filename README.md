GalPot
============

This is a stand-alone version of [Walter Dehnen's GalaxyPotential C++ code](http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/1998MNRAS.294..429D). It is a version I took from the falcON code in the [NEMO Stellar Dynamics Toolbox](http://chara.astro.umd.edu/nemo/), and cut down to stand alone.

It should compile if you run make.

The potentials provided in pot/ are primarily from McMillan (2016), but also from Piffl et al (2014), McMillan (2011) and Dehnen & Binney (1998).

It is under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

It comes with no warranty, especially not from Walter. I leave it here simply for convenience.

The executable file testGalPot.exe shows examples of using GalPot

The other executable files provide simple tools for integration of orbits in the given potentials.
